        <h2>Big promise</h2>
        <p>
            What is in for your prospect ?
            People don't buy the what but the why. There is more interest in the value and outcome of your solution rather than the product.
            Be clear on what you do better than anybody else.
            Communicate more on your products benefits and less about the features.
        </p>

        >Don't commit to just one gym. Get a variety of workouts in every single week, anywhere, anytime</div>

        <h2>Call to action</h2>
        <p>
            You should only be asking your prospect to do one thing, one concise call to action.
            Be sure to repeat your call to action if working on a longer page because confusion is a conversation killer.
